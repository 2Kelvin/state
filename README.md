# state

In this read, I learnt:

- about the `useState` hook
- about the `useState variable` (that retains/holds data between renders) and `usestate setter function` (that updates the useState variable and triggers component rerendering with the new data)
- to import the useState hook (from react) at a the top of the file in order to use it in a project
- that when you use state, you're basically telling React that you want your component to remember something
- that one component can have as many state variables (state) as you want
